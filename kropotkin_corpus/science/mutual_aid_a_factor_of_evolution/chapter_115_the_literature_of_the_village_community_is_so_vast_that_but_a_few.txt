4. The literature of the village community is so vast that but a few
works can be named. Those of Sir Henry Maine, Mr. Seebohm, and Walter's
Das alte Wallis (Bonn, 1859), are well-known popular sources of
information about Scotland, Ireland, and Wales. For France, P. Viollet,
Precis de l'histoire du droit francais. Droit prive, 1886, and several
of his monographs in Bibl. de l'Ecole des Chartes; Babeau, Le Village
sous l'ancien regime (the mir in the eighteenth century), third edition,
1887; Bonnemere, Doniol, etc. For Italy and Scandinavia, the chief works
are named in Laveleye's Primitive Property, German version by K. Bucher.
For the Finns, Rein's Forelasningar, i. 16; Koskinen, Finnische
Geschichte, 1874, and various monographs. For the Lives and Coures,
Prof. Lutchitzky in Severnyi Vestnil, 1891. For the Teutons, besides the
well-known works of Maurer, Sohm (Altdeutsche Reichs-und
Gerichts-Verfassung), also Dahn (Urzeit, Volkerwanderung, Langobardische
Studien), Janssen, Wilh. Arnold, etc. For India, besides H. Maine and
the works he names, Sir John Phear's Aryan Village. For Russia and South
Slavonians, see Kavelin, Posnikoff, Sokolovsky, Kovalevsky, Efimenko,
Ivanisheff, Klaus, etc. (copious bibliographical index up to 1880 in the
Sbornik svedeniy ob obschinye of the Russ. Geog. Soc.). For general
conclusions, besides Laveleye's Propriete, Morgan's Ancient Society,
Lippert's Kulturgeschichte, Post, Dargun, etc., also the lectures of M.
Kovalevsky (Tableau des origines et de l'evolution de la famille et de
la propriete, Stockholm, 1890). Many special monographs ought to be
mentioned; their titles may be found in the excellent lists given by P.
Viollet in Droit prive and Droit public. For other races, see subsequent
notes.
