# Licensing notes

- This corpus is assembled from public-domain English sources (Project Gutenberg, Wikisource, and Anarchist Library exports where applicable).
- Each output file includes a provenance header and is hashed in metadata/manifest.csv.
- The build fails if common boilerplate patterns remain.
- If you add additional texts (e.g., letters), ensure translations/editions are public domain in your jurisdiction.
